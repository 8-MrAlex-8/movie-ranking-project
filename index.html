            <dt>Regular Show</dt>
                <dd>
                    Regular Show is undeniably my most favorite one out of this list.
                    It is a (quite-PG) cartoon series following the lives
                    of Mordecai, Rigby, and their friends at the park where they work at.
                    The show follows a formula of mischief, scientific fantasies which boggles
                    the mind, and at least one count of their boss Benson threatening to fire them. 
                </dd>
            <dt>The Amazing World of Gumball</dt>
                <dd>
                    The world of this cartoon--no pun intended--is very rich and vibrant. Every 
                    character has their own charms and depth, enabling a sweet ride back to
                    one's childhood. Although the show's vibes are very apparently for kids, the
                    show sports some crude humor that a child can only understand once they're older.
                </dd>
            <dt>Money Heist</dt>
                <dd>
                    The first real-life crime drama series in this list follows a band of thieves 
                    who come together under the guidance of "The Professor" to pull off some of
                    the most ambitious heists in history. Driven by rebellion and greed, 
                    their journey is chock-full of guns blazing, smart plans, 
                    and heart-stopping twists. With a striking musical theme, 
                    especially the iconic Bella Ciao, this drama offers viewers an 
                    intense package of mystery, pain, passion, and raw emotion.

            <dt>The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.</dt>
                <dd>
                    This hilarious slice-of-life anime takes you through a psychic--named 
                    Saiki Kusuo--and his attempts to lead a normal life despite his 
                    (admittedly-overpowered) abilities. He also gains some friends throughout the 
                    show who, altogether, lights its audience up with their dynamic. It's a 
                    great humor-filled series that's also quite immersive.
                </dd>
            <dt>Hell's Kitchen</dt>
                <dd>
                    At this point, who hasn't heard of Gordon Ramsay? His cooking show Hell's Kitchen
                    has been a childhood favorite of mine. Chefs from all walks of life battle it 
                    out in a cutthroat kitchen for the chance to achieve their dreams. 
                    From prep to dinner service, along with Gordon's signature temper, Hell's Kitchen 
                    presents its watchers with a solid mix of shouting intensity and culinary art.

            <dt>Asobi Asobase</dt>
                <dd>
                    At first glance, Asobi Asobase seems like an innocent comedy about three schoolgirls 
                    forming a club to pass time. But, it is anything but ordinary. The trio's 
                    misadventures are packed with unexpected, absurd humor that keeps even its loyal
                    watchers guessing! With exaggerated reactions and bizarre situations, 
                    it's a rollercoaster of chaos and comedy that will leave you in stitches. 
                    The ridiculousness of it all makes Asobi Asobase one of the series that I 
                    religiously rewatch.

            <dt>Kingdom</dt>
                <dd>
                    Set in Korea’s Joseon Dynasty, Kingdom blends historical drama with a gripping, 
                    blood-curdling twist. When a mysterious plague begins turning people into ravenous 
                    monsters, Crown Prince Lee Chang must uncover the truth behind the epidemic 
                    while battling political conspiracies that threaten his throne. With its breathtaking 
                    cinematography, intense action, and intricate plot, Kingdom delivers a chilling tale 
                    of survival, power, and humanity amidst an undead apocalypse. It’s a perfect mix of

                <dd>
                    Imagine ending up in a deserted Tokyo where it seems as if you were the most-first 
                    one there--that's the terrifying reality in Alice in Borderland. This show sports
                    some of the most amazing games Arisu and his friends end up in, games where 
                    intelligence, strength, teamwork, and the will to betray are the only ways to survive. 
                    With what it delivers, this show pulls you in from the first moment and doesn't let go. 
                    It's a heart-pounding journey through a world where survival is the ultimate prize.
